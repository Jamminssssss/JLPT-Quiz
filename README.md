## outline, summary

It is an app that allows you to solve the JLPT questions in a quiz, collectively referred to as the Japanese proficiency test.

The quiz was created by referring to the actual JLPT test prints.

The purpose of the production is for the test takers preparing for the JLPT test to check their skills lightly before taking the test.
